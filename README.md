# Introducing RImP: The Rust In multiParty Framework

RImP is an awesome framework that aims to make developing multiparty computation (MPC) applications a breeze. It's designed to be complete, loaded with features, and super flexible.

## Our Vision for RImP

Our vision for RImP is to create a Rust MPC compiler plugin that enhances the language with cool stuff using Rust macros. We also plan to extend it to high-level languages like Python and Julia for even more fun.

## Why Rust?

But why Rust, you ask? Well, Rust is not only hip and trendy, but it also has some killer features. It has a powerful macro system and is super customizable, perfect for generating code and creating domain-specific languages.

While Rust doesn't have built-in support for secure MPC protocols, we believe it can still do the job. In fact, Rust outshines other languages like C/C++ when it comes to applied cryptography. With its strong memory safety, high performance, expressive type system, and concurrency support, Rust is the way to go. Plus, it's compatible with different platforms and has a robust ecosystem. Talk about being secure, efficient, and easy to use for cryptographic applications!

## The Roadmap for RImP

So, what's the plan? Right now, we're in the early stages of designing, modeling, and validating RImP. Developing such a feature-packed framework is no small feat, especially when it involves secure MPC protocols. It requires a deep understanding of cryptography, security, and MPC design principles. But hey, we love a challenge!

## Wanna be a part?

At this stage, we are still defining the building blocks for RImP, but we will surely welcome and even need all the help we can get in the near future. Soon, we will make available references and ideas for even the uninitiated to have a roadmap to follow to develop knowledge and skills to contribute even more. Stay tuned for updates!

## Why We're Doing This

Why are we doing this? Well, besides being a bunch of system development enthusiasts, we truly believe in the future of secure, private distributed systems. We see distributed computing becoming the norm in research and enterprise applications. And to make that happen, we need to simplify things, break down barriers, and ensure privacy without sacrificing the benefits of accessing and processing user information. It's a crucial step, and we're super excited to be a part of it!

So buckle up, folks! RImP is on its way, bringing you the best of MPC development in a fun and user-friendly package. Get ready to revolutionize the world of secure, distributed computing!
